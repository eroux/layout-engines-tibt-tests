# Pillow test

The goal here is to check the possibility to write Tibetan in an image with Pillow.

Pillow needs [libraqm](https://github.com/HOST-Oman/libraqm) in order to work, but as stated on the [installation page](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html): `Raqm support is currently unsupported on Windows.`.

See [this bug report](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/3054)
